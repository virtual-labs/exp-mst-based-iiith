1. Use the k-means algorithm and Euclidean distance to cluster the following 8 examples into 3 clusters: A1=(2,10), A2=(2,5), A3=(8,4), A4=(5,8), A5=(7,5), A6=(6,4), A7=(1,2), A8=(4,9). Suppose that the initial seeds (centers of each cluster) are A1, A4 and A7. Run the k-means algorithm for 1 iteration. At the end of this iteration find: The new clusters.  The centers of the new clusters.  How many more iterations are needed to converge?
