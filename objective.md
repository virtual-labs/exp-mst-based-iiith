The high level goals of the experiment are:  

 1. Understand the idea of data clustering.  
 2. Understand how the choice an clustering algorithm is important for desired results.  
 3. Understand the described two clustering methods K-means and MST based.  
 4. Understand the difference between the two approaches used and the different results that these may give on similar data.
